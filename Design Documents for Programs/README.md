This folder contains various design documents and README documents for programs that a novice programmer should be able to understand. I have built these programs, and have chosen to not upload the code to GitHub. The design documents aims to simplify and break down the basics needed to build the given program at hand. The README is a simple tutorial that anyone should be able to follow to run the program if they have the program.

I have not provided the source code for these programs due to the reason that some were created for university assignments.
