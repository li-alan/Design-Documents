# Design-Documents
This repository contains various design documents that I have created or written up for the various tasks and projects I have previously worked on.

Art and Animation: This project paper is intended to inform and teach audiences about the various technical aspects of tools and advancements in the field of art and animation. It will also go into the basics of using some of these various tools. Animation has a rich history of evolution and growth; these improvements are still seen in many of todayâ€™s tools. I aim to show you how they operate and live on. This will also include technical aspects such as the tools and tricks that animators have used to create special effects like parallax in their works. At the end, I will give a technical guide on how to use and operate the modern day art and animation program, Procreate. The intended audience are readers who may have little to no knowledge on this particular topic and may want to learn more about it. No prior knowledge is needed to understand the content, though some may find it helpful to understand topics if one has already looked into the subject content. The chosen style guide of this paper is that of the MLA format.



LaTeX Tutorial: A tutorial written to server as a LaTeX tutorial for novice engineering students. This tutorial is useful if you wan to learn the basics and create professional looking documents. It goes over topics such as creating a LaTeX file, making tables, and formatting. LaTeX is flexible and allows for a large amount of customization that other applications do not offer. This paper is also written using LaTeX



Literature Review: This literature review is intended to provide readers with more in depth knowledge and understanding of how the Godzilla character has been interpreted in scholarly papers over the decades.The aspects associated with these rather seemingly innocently films may hold more meaning and depth than one may initially expect. Perhaps Godzilla is more than a simple science fiction entertainment piece. This paper is written using LaTeX.
